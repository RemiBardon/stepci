# Setup and Teardown steps

The `before` and `after` sections are optional top level sections that can be used to run steps before or after the `tests` section has run. These sections can be useful to set up or tear down test data.

Any variable captured in the `before` section will be available in the `tests` and `after` sections. However, since variables captured in individual tests are not shared to other tests, any variable captured in the `tests` section will **not** be available in the `after` section.

::: warning
Steps defined in `before` and `after` sections are ran as tests and will therefore be reported as such. Those steps will count in the overall results summary and any `check` failure will cause the entire run to report as failed.

**Example usage**
